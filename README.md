## Concept:

Medieval Mayhem is a 2d turn based fighting game.  You gain varying amounts of Gold after each round depending on the difficulty of the boss faced. At any time you have the ability to go the the store and purchase health potions, armor upgrades, train skills, or work on your weapon accuracy.  Each round the bosses get progressively tougher, and have different skills sets. Get through all of the bosses in one piece and you are victorious!

## Technologies Used:

## Approach:

#### Overview
At the start of development I felt somewhat confident I could make this game if it just ran in the browser. The challange to me would be bringing it to the DOM and making it visually appealing.   

#### Wireframe

Color Pallet:

```
    #f15a29
    #dfa53a
    #dadd22
    #5d7a44
    #5f5034
    #000000
    #ffffff
```

#### User stories

As a user I expect to see a game that would be easy to traverse
the layout based on games that previous have looked similar to me.
I should already have a basic knowledge/expectation of how to play.
Regardless of that there should be a rules button clearly in view 
that will explain how the game is played.  I also expect some sort 
of visual feedback on my actions in the game based on what should 
happen in similar games(IE push attack button see character attack
and then see the results of it).

#### Development Plan 

Originally started out as a 2d fighting game with v]basic DOM elements involved.  Since then I have worked to create animated sprites to equate to what action is actually happening under the hood.

* Development Plan  ONE
* Development Plan  Two
* Development Plan  Three 
* Development Plan  Four

#### MVP

* MVP ONE
* MVP Two
* MVP Three 
* MVP Four

#### Stretch goals

* Add soun effects
* Add more skills/upgradess
* Add more bosses and levels 
* Skill and attribute balance, balance and balance some more..

## Challenges:

Adding animated sprites to make the fight more dynamic.
Creating and adding various modals for some of the game events.
