## Concept:

Medieval Mayhem is a 2d turn based fighting game.  You gain varying amounts of Gold after each round depending on the difficulty of the boss faced. At any time you have the ability to go the the store and purchase health potions, armor upgrades, train skills, or work on your weapon accuracy.  Each round the bosses get progressively tougher, and have different skills sets. Get through all of the bosses in one piece and you are victorious!

## Approach:

#### Overview
At the start of development I felt somewhat confident I could make this game if it just ran in the browser. The challange to me would be bringing it to the DOM and making it visually appealing.
